Case1:

<http://example.org/inst/ChickenHut>
        a       <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource> , <http://example.org/term/tourismObject> ;
        <http://example.org/term/TripAdvisorRating>
                <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#3.5> .

For the Chicken Hut, since it is the subject of the triples, its type is a resource and it is defined by RDFS.
Since the Chicken Hut has the property of "TripAdvisorRating", so it must be a instance of tourism objects and this is inferred by
the triple of ":TripAdvisorRating rdfs:domain :tourismObject .".


Case2:

<http://example.org/inst/Museion>
        a       <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource> , <http://example.org/term/tourismAttraction> , <http://example.org/term/tourismObject> , <http://example.org/term/artMuseum> , <http://example.org/term/museum> , <http://example.org/term/modernArtMuseum> .

For the Museion, since it is the subject of the triples, its type is a resource and it is defined by RDFS.
From the triple of "i:Museion rdf:type :modernArtMuseum .", we know that the Museion is an instance of the
modernArtMuseum class and the inferring process belows.
Since modernArtMuseum is a subclass of artMuseum, so the Museion is an instance of artMuseum.
Since artMuseum is a subclass of museum, so the Museion is an instance of museum.
Since museum is a subclass of tourismAttraction, so the Museion is an instance of tourismAttraction.
Since tourismAttraction is a subclass of tourismObject, so the Museion is an instance of tourismObject.
